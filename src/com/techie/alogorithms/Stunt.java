     * type in the reviews search bar thÃ¨ relevant

     * Write an algorithm that will output a maximum of
     * three keyword suggestions after each character is
     * typed by the customer in the search field.
     * If there are more than three acceptable keywords,
     * return the keywords that are first in alphabetical
     * order.
     * Only return keyword suggestions after the
     * customer has entered two characters.
     * Keyword suggestions must start with the
     * characters already typed
     * Both the repository and the customerQuery
     * should be compared in a case-insensitive way.
     * @param repository
